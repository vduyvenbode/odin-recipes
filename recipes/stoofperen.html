    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        A simple, but delicious recipe for poached pears in red wine. You only need a handful of ingredients.
        You can eat the pears as a dessert, warm or cold, but in the Netherlands we traditionally eat stewed pears as a
        side dish for Christmas.
        I prefer them cold.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large firm pears - peeled, cored, and quartered</li>
        <li>Â½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>peel of 1 orange</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>1 (750 milliliter) bottle red wine </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place pears in a saucepan. Add sugar, orange peel, and cinnamon stick.
            Pour in red wine to cover pears completely.
            Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer gently until pears are soft and deep red in color, about 2 1/2
            hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer pears to a serving plate using a slotted spoon. Serve the pears warm or cold.
        </li>
    </ol>
